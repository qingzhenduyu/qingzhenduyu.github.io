I am a first-year graduate student in [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, advised by [Prof.Liangcai Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6Ia92WsAAAAJ). Before that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Data Science from [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University in 2023.

My research interests include OCR, Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition(HMER) and Multi-Resolution Image Generation. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me.
